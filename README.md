This repository contains the source code and models of our NDSS 2020 paper [A Practical Approach for Taking Down Avalanche Botnets Under Real-World Constraints](https://lepoch.at/files/avalanche-ndss20.pdf).

* `feature_generation` contains the code for parsing raw input data, extracting feature values and ground truth, and exporting them to input files for the machine learning classifier.

Due to the sensitivity of the ground truth provided by law enforcement and commercial agreements for the third-party data sets, we cannot share the raw input data.
